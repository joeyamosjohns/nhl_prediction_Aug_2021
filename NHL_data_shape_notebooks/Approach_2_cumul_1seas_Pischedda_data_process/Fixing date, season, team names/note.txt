These files are where I devoloped the code to fix dates, season, etc.

There is a nice final version of this in the .py files 

The others folder tools for fixing dates were made slightly earlier
The shape_data copies the functions from that folder to the top of the file.

There are v1, v2, v3 of shape_data just because I think I got muddled and started fresh each time
